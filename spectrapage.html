<h2> Widgets </h2>
    <ul>
         <li><strong> Spectra drop-down list: </strong> A selectable drop-down widget, whose values are all the Spectrum objects currently stored in the App instance. </li>
         <li><strong> Files drop-down list: </strong> A selectable drop-down widget of all the files loaded into the App instance. </li>
         <li><strong> Table viewer: </strong> A scrollable textbox widget, blank initially, that, when an item is selected from either drop-down list, will configure itself to contain the data of the item, formatted "nicely" (fixed width). </li>
         <li><strong> Table viewer label: </strong> A label which will contain the name of the item when selected from one of the drop-down lists. </li>
         <li><strong> Spectra buttons: </strong> Buttons which trigger popups to manipulate `Spectrum` objects. </li>
         <li><strong> Duplicate button </strong></li>
         <li><strong> Delete button </strong></li>
         <li><strong> Save button </strong></li>
         <li><strong> Arithmetic button </strong></li>

         <li><strong> Zero Spectrum button </strong></li>
    </ul>

<h2> Popups </h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong> Duplicate Spectrum popup: </strong> Instantiated by the "Duplicate" button, this popup enables the user to make a copy of a `Spectrum` object under a new name. This is useful for when one wants to do some processing on a spectrum, but does not want to destroy her original data. The user must select the source spectrum form the drop-down list, then provide a name for the new `Spectrum` object. The name must be different from the name of the source, but does not necessarily have to be different from other active spectra. In the latter case, the previous `Spectrum` object will be overwritten. All other attributes will be identical to the source. </li>
        <li><strong> Delete Spectrum popup: </strong> Instantiated by the "Delete" button, this popup allows the user to delete a `Spectrum` object from the `App`'s memory. </li>
        <li><strong> Save Spectrum popup: </strong> Instantiated by the "Save" button, this popup allows the user to save the `df` attribute of a `Spectrum` as a csv file. The user must choose the `Spectrum` she wants to save, then, when she presses 'OK', a "Save As" file dialog will open, allowing her to choose a filename and directory. </li>
        <li><strong> Spectral Arithmetic popup: </strong> Instantiated by the "Arithmetic" button, this popup allows the user to perform various arithmetic operations on one or two spectra. The user must provide the desired name of the result spectrum, the operation to be performed, and the operand(s). The operation will be performed on the `y` attribute of the operand(s), and a `Spectrum` object with the same `x` attribute, and the new `y` and `df` attributes will be reurned, with the `name`` provided. The available operations are:
            <ul>
                <li>add</li>
                <li>subtract</li>
                <li>multiply</li>
                <li>divide</li>
                <li>to_absorption</li>
                <li>to_transmittance</li>
            </ul> </li>
        <li><strong> Grinding Curve popup: </strong> Instantiated by the "Grinding Curve" button, this popup permits the user to create a grinding curve from spectra of carbonate minerals. Actually, the operation will succeed with any spectra, but is most sensibly applied to calcite and aragonite spectra. The user must provide a name for the result curve, select the mineral frim the drop-down list, and select the operands from the listbox. The result will be a `Spectrum` object. </li>
        <li><strong> Zero Spectrum popup: </strong> Instantiated by the "Zero Spectrum" button, this popup enables the user to make the y Series of the `Spectrum` equal zero between to point indices. The user must provide a name, the source, and the left and right indices for the zeroing operation. If the user wishes to zero the spectrum without creating a separate object, she just has to enter the name of the source spectrum. </li>
    </ul>
