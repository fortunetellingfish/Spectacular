<h2> Widgets </h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong> Name entry: </strong> Text entry widget for entering the name you wish to use for the `Spectrum` object. </li>
        <li><strong> File selector: </strong> Drop-down list for choosing the source file for the data of the `Spectrum` object. </li>
        <li><strong>  x Column selector: </strong> Drop-down list for choosing the column of the source file that will become the independent axis of the `Spectrum` object.</li>
        <li><strong> y Column selector: </strong> Drop-down list for choosing the column of the source file that will become the dependent axis of the `Spectrum` object. </li>
        <li><strong> Create Spectrum button: </strong> This button will instantiate a `Spectrum` object and add it to the `App`'s `spectra` dictionary if all the fields are filled out. If the process succeeds, the alert box will read "Spectrum added to list." </li>
        <li><strong> Preview text box: </strong> When a source is selected from the file selector, the data will be displayed in the Preview box on the right hand side of the page. </li>
    </ul>
<p>
    All data must be represented as a `Spectrum` object before it can be manipulated, so this page should generally be the first you visit after you load a file.
